## Overview
### Description
Helps people meet new outdoor peers to explore new areas around. Whether it is for a hike, biking or surfing, the app can help find a group of people to adventure around.


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Nature
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but could work as a website as well on a computer
- **Story:** Utilizes user's location to show relevant feed of others' adventures in the area and suggests groups that they could join.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they want to do outdoor activites. 
- **Scope:** First the user has to create a user profile. Then the user would be invited to join a groupchat based on the activity that they chose. The user can invite others to join and has the ability to leave as well.
